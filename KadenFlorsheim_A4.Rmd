##The majority of Napa's population is white but amongst most races that make up a proportion of the overall population (Including: Black or African American, Asian, Two or More Races), there does not appear to be disproportionate educational attainment in Napa (Amongst people over the age of 25.) However, for people that fall into the category of "Some Other Race Alone" there does appear to be disproportianate educational attainment. Despite making up only around 10 percent of the overall population, they make up over 25% of the Napa population that has attained less than a high school diploma. They also disproportinatly represent a very small percentage of the population that has attained a Bachelor's degree or higher.
